"title": "Swiss farmers protest at subsidy cuts",
"text": "On Wednesday, farmers came together in Bern to protest against planned cuts to subsidies, reported RTS.\n\nBecause of the way farming is structured in Switzerland, farmers are heavily reliant on the support of tax payers to make ends meet. \n\nThe federal government, which is running and projecting fiscal deficits, has come up with ways to cut spending. According to the government, the cuts are spread across the board, which includes savings on the amounts it spends supporting farmers. The government plans to cut several hundreds of million francs from farm subsidies from 2025 to 2029.\n\nHowever, the Swiss Farmers’ Union and other groups representing farmers argue that the agricultural sector is not responsible for the fiscal deficits and should therefore not be hit by the savings measures. Reducing financial support for farmers will hurt an already vulnerable sector, argues the union. \n\nFarming unions say that farming is one of the worst paid sectors in Switzerland, with wages equivalent to CHF 17 per hour. Many Swiss farms are small and run by single families. With limited resources, families sometimes end up working long hours to get everything done.\n\nTraditionally, public support for farmers has been high in Switzerland. However, a reader poll run by RTS suggests support may be waining. When asked whether the current anger expressed by farmers is justified, 58% said no and 42% said yes.\n\nMore on this:RTS article (in French) – Take a 5 minute French test now\n\nFor more stories like this on Switzerland follow us on Facebook and Twitter.",

The new jet is expected to be used for the first time in spring 2025.\n\nThe aircraft is undergoing final assembly in Montreal and is scheduled to be transferred to Switzerland at the end of 2024. Ground and cockpit staff will then be trained before the plane is used for official flights by the end of 2025.\n\nWith a range of 14,260 km and a top speed of 982 km/h, the Bombardier jet has a significantly greater range and autonomy than any aircraft in the current fleet.

"title": "Widespread hygiene deficiencies in Swiss hospitals",
"text": "According to a study by Swissmedic, there are deficiencies in the disinfection, sterilisation, packaging and storage of medical products in Swiss hospitals. \n\nThe recently published report based on a study done in 2023 by Swissmedic shows that almost all of the 25 Swiss hospitals inspected have deficiencies in the disinfection, sterilisation, packaging and storage of medical products.\n\nIn addition, the problem is becoming worse. An earlier study done in 2021 and 2022 found fewer deficiencies. According to Swissmedic there is a lack of awareness of hygiene protocols. 91% of all inspections showed deficiencies, according to the study. The same figure last time was 60%. Procedures related to the packaging and storage of medical products were deficient in 82% of cases. Last time the percentage was 63.\n\nThe cleaning of products is increasingly being outsourced. A company called Sermax processes medical products on behalf of some hospitals. This reflects a lack of staff in hospitals and cost pressures. \n\nA representative for Switzerland’s hospitals said he welcomes the report, adding that It helps us to improve. \n\nThe director of a hospital in Biel/Bienne said the results must be put into context. Switzerland is one of the leading countries when it comes to hygiene standards, he said. However, Swissmedic says the deficiencies are problematic. They can have an impact on product safety and patients.\n\nHospitals need to implement improvement measures in order to ensure their compliance with the legal requirements, said Swissmedic. And because these measures are highly relevant for patient safety, Swissmedic has intensified both its monitoring and its collaboration with experts in jointly drawing up basic guidelines for improving quality assurance. \n\nMore on this:SRF article (in German) \n\nSwissmedic report \n\nFor more stories like this on Switzerland follow us on Facebook and Twitter.",

"title": "Swiss university remains top-ranked in continental Europe",
"text": "ETH Zurich remains the best university in continental Europe, according to the World University Ranking, published by Times Higher Education. ETH Zurich was ranked eleventh worldwide in the 2024 ranking, the same position as in 2023.\n\nThe Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL), the next Swiss university in the ranking moved up one position from last year to 32nd. \n\nThe global winner for 2024 was the University of Oxford, which has held first place for the ninth time in a row. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University followed in second and third places.\n\nSuch rankings are controversial. Trying to boil the quality of a university down to a single number is both challenging and simplistic. In March, the University of Zurich decided to withdraw from the process of being ranked. A key criticism was the dysfunctional incentives created by the KPIs behind the rankings.\n\nETH Zurich board chairman Michael Hengartner told SRF that universities are practically impossible to compare. It is difficult, if not impossible to reduce complex institutions such as universities to a single number, he said. They are far too varied in their form, tasks, and nature. It’s a bit like comparing and ranking animals in an ecosystem. Should a mouse be ranked behind an elephant because it is smaller?\n\nThe way organisations are structured can have a significant impact on ranking. For example, unlike well known foreign universities, Swiss universities are not selective. All high school graduates can enrol. This means there are more students per professor than at selective universities like Oxford and Harvard. This ratio drags Swiss universities down in the rankings. But Switzerland does not want to change this to improve the ranking of its universities. Having public universities that are open to all school graduates helps to reduce the educational elitism seen in the US and the UK where talent is more likely to overlooked. It may also contribute to making Switzerland the most inventive nation in the world – Switzerland consistently files the highest number of patents per capita.\n\nIn 2023, the per capita patent rate was 1,085 per million in Switzerland. The next closest nation was Sweden with 495 per million. The US (142) and the UK (87) were both well behind Switzerland. in 2023, Switzerland filed 60% more patents than the UK despite having a population 13% of its size – see data here.\n\nMore on this:RTS article (in French) – Take a 5 minute French test now\n\nFor more stories like this on Switzerland follow us on Facebook and Twitter.",
